# Assignment of COP290

## Swan
Swan is a social networking site designed to provide users with a platform to connect with like-minded individuals and share their thoughts, ideas, and experiences through posts that can include both images and text. The site is fully unmoderated, giving users the power to create communities, invite friends, share posts, and comment on others' posts.

One of the site's key features is the ability to create communities or groups based on shared interests or hobbies. Users can join or create communities to connect with others who share their passions and engage in discussions around common topics.

Another important aspect of the site is the trending section, which highlights the most popular and engaging posts from across the platform. Users can browse the trending section to discover new content and engage with other users around popular topics.

The site also offers a friends feature that allows users to connect with others and follow their activity on the platform. Users can interact with their friends by commenting on their posts.

The site's feed is based on the comment interaction of all posts and the bias of the communities joined by the user. This means that the more comments a post receives, the more likely it is to appear in a user's feed. Additionally, the site takes into account the communities that the user has joined and the level of interaction within those communities to determine which posts should be prioritized in the feed.
